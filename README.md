```plaintext
This is a text box with a gray background.
You can write text here.
```
```

In this example, the code block uses the `plaintext` language, which is typically used for displaying plain text, not code. However, it creates the effect of a gray background for your text box.

You can replace the content inside the code block with your text. The text inside the code block won't be treated as code, so you can use it for any descriptive or informative text you want to highlight with a gray background.
